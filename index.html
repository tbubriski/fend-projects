      <h4 class="uppercase">My Job Experience</h4>
      <p class="subTitle experience">Electrical Engineer</p>
        <p class="experienceInfo">I was an Electrical Engineer working as a Application Engineer and then a Design Engineer specifically for power supply/DC-DC converters for six years after graduating from WPI.
        <span class="moreText">When my son was about ten months old, I went from a working mom to a stay-at-home mom. I took him to music classes and play groups so he could enjoy his early years with friends.</span></p>

      <p class="subTitle experience"> Front-End Web Developer</p>
        <p class="experienceInfo"><span class="moreText">Once my two kids started going to school full-time, I wanted to learn to do something new with a flexible schedule. That was when I found out about the Grow with Google Front-End Development Scholarship Program.</span>
        I was fortunate enough to move on from Phase I to Phase II of the program. I learned so much from working through the course materials within a short ten weeks. This Portfolio is actually my first Project in Phase II.</p>

    <div class="interests">
      <h4 class="uppercase">My Interests</h4>
      <p class="subTitle interest">Origami<img src="origamiDevil.jpg" alt="Origami Devil" /><p>
        <p class="interestInfo">I love using a sheet of plain paper and making it into complicated artwork.
        <span class="moreText">This is an origami model that took me about two weeks to master. It is the Origami Devil created by Origami Artist Jun Maekawa.</span></p>

      <p class="subTitle interest">Sketching and Painting<img src="quickSketch.jpg" alt="Quick Sketch" /></p>
        <p class="interestInfo">I just began experimenting with watercolors and I love watching the interaction between water, pigment, and paper.
          <span class="moreText">I sketched this image during Thanksgiving morning. I saw a picture of this structure online and thought to myself, "it looks simple, let me try and draw it!"</span></p>

      <p class="subTitle interest">LEGO<img src="legoEggDecorator.jpg" alt="LEGO Egg Decorator I made for Easter." /></p>
        <p class="interestInfo">I love building with LEGOs especially creating models that needs power to move.</p>
        <span class="moreText">This egg decorator model is a simplified version of a lot of similar models you can find online. Originally I tried to make it with a lot more gears with a fixed output battery pack, but I ran out of the gears that I needed. so I decided to use an adjustable power block instead.
          By varying the speed one gear, I was about to optimize the support the axles could provide to make the spin as smooth as possible. I was very happy with this creation.</span></p>
